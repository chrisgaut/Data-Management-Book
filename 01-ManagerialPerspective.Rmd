# Section 1: The Managerial Perspective {-}

*People only see what they are prepared to see*.

> Ralph Waldo Emerson, *Journals*, 1863

Organizations are accumulating vast volumes of data because of the ease
with which data can be captured and distributed in digital format (e.g.,
smartphone cameras and tweets). The world's data are estimated to be
doubling every 1-2 years, and large companies now routinely manage
petabytes (10^15^ bytes) of data every day. Data management is a
critical function for many organizations.

The first section of this book prepares you to see the role of data and
information in an organization. The managerial perspective on data
management concentrates on why enterprises design and maintain data
management systems, or organizational memories. Chapter 1 examines this
topic by detailing the components of organizational memory and then
discussing some of its common problems. The intention is to make you
aware of the scope of data management and its many facets. Chapter 2
discusses the relationship between information and organizational goals.
Again, a very broad outlook is adopted in order to provide a sweeping
perspective on the relationship of information to organizational success
and change.

At this point, we want to give you some ***maps*** for understanding the
territory you will explore. Since the terrain is possibly very new,
these maps initially may be hard to read, and so you may need to consult
them several times before you understand the landscape you are about to
enter.

The first map is based on the Newell-Simon model^1^ of the human
information processing system, which shows that humans receive input,
process it, and produce output. The processing is done by a processor,
which is linked to a memory that stores both data and processes. The
processor component retrieves both data and processes from memory.

![](Figures/Section 1/Simon-Newell.png)

To understand this model, consider a person arriving on a flight who has
agreed to meet a fellow traveler in the terminal. She receives a text
message to meet her friend at B27. The message is input to her human
information processing system. She retrieves the process for
interpreting the message (i.e., decoding that B27 means terminal B and
gate 27) and finds the terminal and gate. The person then walks to the
terminal and gate, the output. Sometimes these processes are so well
ingrained in our memory that we never think about retrieving them. We
just do them automatically.

Human information processing systems are easily overloaded. Our memory
is limited, and our ability to process data is restricted; thus we use a
variety of external tools to extend and augment our capacities. A
contacts app is an instance of external data memory. A recipe, a
description of the process for preparing food, is an example of external
process memory. Smartphones are now the external processor of choice
that we use to augment our limited processing capacity.

The original model of human information processing can be extended to
include external memory, for storing data and processes, and external
processors, for executing processes.

***Missing this image***

This model of augmented human information processing translates directly
to an organizational setting. Organizations collect inputs from the
environment: market research, customer complaints, and competitor
actions. They process these data and produce outputs: sales campaigns,
new products, price changes, and so on. The following figure gives an
example of how an organization might process data. As a result of some
market research (input), a marketing analyst (an internal processor)
retrieves sales data (data) and does a sales forecast (process). The
analyst also requests a marketing consultant (an external processor) to
analyze (process) some demographic reports (data) before deciding to
launch a new sales campaign (output).

![](Figures/Section 1/org info processing.png)

An organization's memory comes in a variety of forms, as you will see in
Chapter 1. This memory also can be divided into data and processes. The
data part may contain information about customers. The process portion
may store details of how to handle a customer order. Organizations use a
variety of processors to handle data, including people and computers.
Organizations also rely on external sources to extend their information
processing capacity. For example, a business may use a specialist credit
agency to check a customer's creditworthiness, or an engineering firm
may use a cloud computing service for structural analysis of a bridge.
Viewed this way, the augmented human information processing model
becomes a pattern for an organizational information processing system.

This book focuses on the data side of organizational memory. While it is
primarily concerned with data stored within the organization, there is
also coverage of data in external memory. The process side of
organizational memory is typically covered in a systems analysis and
design or a business process management course.

## 1. Managing Data  {-}

*All the value of this company is in its people. If you burned down all our plants, and we just kept our people and our information files, we should soon be as strong as ever.*

> Thomas Watson, Jr., former chairman of IBM^2^

### Learning objectives {-}

Students completing this chapter will

* understand the key concepts of data management;

* recognize that there are many components of an organization's memory;

* understand the problems with existing data management systems;

* realize that successful data management requires an integrated
understanding of organizational behavior and information technology.

### Introduction {-}

Imagine what would happen to a bank that forgot who owed it money or a
magazine that lost the names and addresses of its subscribers. Both
would soon be in serious difficulty, if not out of business.
Organizations have data management systems to record the myriad of
details necessary for transacting business and making informed
decisions. Since the birth of agriculture, societies and organizations
have recorded data. The system may be as simple as carving a notch in a
stick to keep a tally, or as intricate as modern database technology. A
memory system can be as personal as a to-do list or as public as a
library.

The management of organizational data, generally known as data
management, requires skills in designing, using, and managing the memory
systems of modern organizations. It requires multiple perspectives. Data
managers need to see the organization as a social system and to
understand data management technology. The integration of these views,
the socio-technical perspective, is a prerequisite for successful data
management.

Individuals also need to manage data. You undoubtedly are more familiar
with individual memory management systems. They provide a convenient way
of introducing some of the key concepts of data management.

### Individual data management {-}

As humans, we are well aware of our limited capacity to remember many
things. The brain, our internal memory, can get overloaded with too much
detail, and its memory decays with time. We store a few things
internally: our cell phone number, where we last parked our car, and
faces of people we have met recently. We use external memory to keep
track of those many things we would like to remember. External memory
comes in a variety of forms.

On our smartphones, we have calendars to remind us of meetings and
project deadlines. We have a contact app to record the addresses and
phone numbers of those we contact frequently. We use to-do lists to
remind us of the things we must do today or this week. The interesting
thing about these aides-mémoire is that each has a unique way of storing
data and supporting its rapid retrieval.

Calendars come in many shapes and forms, but they are all based on the
same organizing principle. A set amount of space is allocated for each
day of the year, and the spaces are organized in date and time order,
which supports rapid retrieval. Some calendars have added features to
speed up access. For example, electronic calendars usually have a button
to select today's data.

*A calendar*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/calendar.png)

Address books also have a standard format. They typically contain
predefined spaces for storing address details (e.g., name, company,
phone, and email). Access is often supported by a set of buttons for
each letter of the alphabet and a search engine.

*An address book*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/address book.png)

The structure of to-do lists tends to be fairly standard. They are often
set up in list format with a small left-hand margin. The idea is to
enter each item to be done on the right side of the screen. The left
side is used to check (√) or mark those tasks that have been completed.
The beauty of the check method is that you can quickly scan the left
side to identify incomplete tasks.

*A to-do or reminder list*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/todo list new.png)

Many people use some form of the individual memory systems just
described. They are typically included in the suite of standard
applications for a smart phone.

These three examples of individual memory systems illustrate some
features common to all data management systems:

* There is a storage medium. Data are stored electronically in each case.

* There is a structure for storing data. For instance, the address book
has labeled spaces for entering pertinent data.

* The interface organized for rapid data entry and retrieval. A calendar
is stored in date and time sequence so that the data space for any
appointment for a particular day can be found quickly.

* The selection of a data management system frequently requires a
trade-off decision. In these examples, the trade-off is screen
dimensions versus the amount of data that can be seen without scrolling.
For example, you will notice the address book screen is truncated and
will need to be scrolled to see full address details.

| Smart phones have dramatically changed individual data management in the |
| last few years. We now have calendars, address books, to-do lists, and   |
| many more apps literally in our hands. What individual data are still    |
| difficult to manage? What might be the characteristics of an app for     |
| these data?                                                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

There are differences between internal and external memories. Our
internal memory is small, fast, and convenient (our brain is always with
us---well, most of the time). External memory is often slower to
reference and not always as convenient. The two systems are
interconnected. We rely on our internal memory to access external
memory. Our internal memory and our brain's processing skills manage the
use of external memories. For example, we depend on our internal memory
to recall how to use our smartphone and its apps. Again, we see some
trade-offs. Ideally, we would like to store everything in our fast and
convenient internal memory, but its limited capacity means that we are
forced to use external memory for many items.

### Organizational data management {-}

Organizations, like people, need to remember many things. If you look
around any office, you will see examples of the apparatus of
organizational memory: people, bookshelves, planning boards, and
computers. The same principles found in individual memory systems apply
to an organization's data management systems.

There is a storage medium. In the case of computers, the storage medium
varies. Small files might be stored on a USB drive and large, archival
files on a magnetic disk. In Chapter 11, we discuss electronic storage
media in more detail.

A table is a common structure for storing data. For example, if we want
to store details of customers, we can set up a table with each row
containing individual details of a customer and each column containing
data on a particular feature (e.g., customer code).

Storage devices are organized for rapid data entry and retrieval. Time
is the manager's enemy: too many things to be done in too little time.
Customers expect rapid responses to their questions and quick processing
of their transactions. Rapid data access is a key goal of nearly all
data management systems, but it always comes at a price. Fast access
memories cost more, so there is nearly always a trade-off between access
speed and cost.

As you will see, selecting *how* and *where* to store organizational
data frequently involves a trade-off. Data managers need to know and
understand what the compromises entail. They must know the key questions
to ask when evaluating choices.

When we move from individual to organizational memory, some other
factors come into play. To understand these factors, we need to review
the different types of information systems. The automation of routine
business transactions was the earliest application of information
technology to business. A transaction processing system (TPS) handles
common business tasks such as accounting, inventory, purchasing, and
sales. The realization that the data collected by these systems could be
sorted, summarized, and rearranged gave birth to the notion of a
management information system (MIS). Furthermore, it was recognized that
when internal data captured by a TPS is combined with appropriate
external data, the raw material is available for a decision support
system (DSS). Online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining, business
intelligence (BI), and machine learning are techniques analyzing data
captured by business transactions and gathered from other sources (these
systems are covered in detail in Chapter 14). The purpose of each of
these systems is described in the following table and their
interrelationship can be understood by examining the information systems
cycle.

*Types of information systems*


         Type of information system      System's purpose
  ------ ------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TPS    Transaction processing system   Collect and store data from routine transactions
  MIS    Management information system   Convert data from a TPS into information for planning, controlling, and managing an organization
  DSS    Decision support system         Support managerial decision making by providing models for processing and analyzing data
  BI     Business intelligence           Gather, store, and analyze data to improve decision making
  OLAP   Online analytical processing    Provide a multidimensional view of data
         Data mining                     Use of statistical analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to identify hidden relationships in data
         Machine learning                Using software to make decisions or recommendations traditionally made by humans.

#### The information systems cycle {-}

The various systems and technologies found in an organization are linked
in a cycle. The routine ongoing business of the organization is
processed by TPSs, the systems that handle the present. Data collected
by TPSs are stored in databases, a record of the past, the history of
the organization and its interaction with those with whom it conducts
business. These data are converted into information by analysts using a
variety of software (e.g., a DSS). These technologies are used by the
organization to prepare for the future (e.g., sales in Finland have
expanded, so we will build a new service center in Helsinki). The
business systems created to prepare for the future determine the
transactions the company will process and the data that will be
collected, and the process continues. The entire cycle is driven by
people using technology (e.g., a customer booking a hotel room via a Web
browser).

*The information systems cycle*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/IS cycle.png)

Decision making, or preparing for the future, is the central activity of
modern organizations. Today's organizations are busy turning out goods,
services, and decisions. Knowledge and information workers, over half of
the U.S. labor force, produce the bulk of GDP. Many of these people are
decision makers. Their success, and their organization's as well,
depends on the quality of their decisions.

Industrial society is a producer of goods, and the hallmark of success
is product quality. Japanese manufacturers convincingly demonstrated
that focusing on product quality is the key to market leadership and
profitability. The methods and the philosophy of quality gurus, such as
W. Edwards Deming, have been internationally recognized and adopted by
many providers of goods and services. We are now in the information age
as is evidenced by the key consumer products of the times, such as smart
phones, tablets, and wearables. These are all information appliances,
and they are supported by a host of information services. For example,
consider how Apple connects together its various devices and services
through cloud-based systems. For example, a person can buy an electronic
book from Apple's store to read with the iBooks app on an iPhone or
iPad.

In the information society, which is based on innovation, knowledge, and
services, the key determinant of success has shifted from product
quality to decision quality. In the turbulent environment of global
business, successful organizations are those able to quickly make
high-quality decisions about what customers will buy, how much they will
pay, and how to deliver a high-quality experience with a minimum of
fuss. Companies are very dependent on information systems to create
value for their customers.

#### Desirable attributes of data {-}

Once we realize the critical importance of data to organizations, we can
recognize some desirable attributes of data.

*Desirable attributes of data*

  Shareable       Readily accessed by more than one person at a time
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Transportable   Easily moved to a decision maker
  Secure          Protected from destruction and unauthorized use
  Accurate        Reliable, precise records
  Timely          Current and up-to-date
  Relevant        Appropriate to the decision

##### Shareable {-}

Organizations contain many decision makers. There are occasions when
more than one person will require access to the same data at the same
time. For example, in a large bank it would not be uncommon for two
customer representatives simultaneously to want data on the latest rate
for a three-year certificate of deposit. As data become more volatile,
shareability becomes more of a problem. Consider a restaurant. The
permanent menu is printed, today's special might be displayed on a
blackboard, and the waiter tells you what is no longer available.

##### Transportable {-}

Data should be transportable from their storage location to the decision
maker. Technologies that transport data have a long history. Homing
pigeons were used to relay messages by the Egyptians and Persians 3,000
years ago. The telephone revolutionized business and social life because
it rapidly transmitted voice data. Computers have changed the nature of
many aspects of business because they enable the transport of text,
visuals, voice and video.

Today, transportability is more than just getting data to a decision
maker's desk. It means getting product availability data to a
salesperson in a client's office or advising a delivery driver, en
route, of address details for an urgent parcel pickup. The general
notion is that decision makers should have access to relevant data
whenever and wherever required, although many organizations are still
some way from reaching this target.

##### Secure {-}

In an information society, organizations value data as a resource. As
you have already learned, data support day-to-day business transactions
and decision making. Because the forgetful organization will soon be out
of business, organizations are very vigilant in protecting their data.
There are a number of actions that organizations take to protect data
against loss, sabotage, and theft. A common approach is to duplicate
data and store the copy, or copies, at other locations. This technique
is popular for data stored in computer systems. Access to data is often
restricted through the use of physical barriers (e.g., a vault) or
electronic barriers (e.g., a password). Another approach, which is
popular with firms that employ knowledge workers, is a noncompete
contract. For example, some software companies legally restrain computer
programmers from working for a competitor for two years after they
leave, hoping to prevent the transfer of valuable data, in the form of
the programmer's knowledge of software, to competitors.

##### Accurate {-}

You probably recall friends who excel in exams because of their good
memories. Similarly, organizations with an accurate memory will do
better than their less precise competitors. Organizations need to
remember many details precisely. For example, an airline needs accurate
data to predict the demand for each of its flights. The quality of
decision making will drop dramatically if managers use a data management
system riddled with errors.

Polluted data threatens a firm's profitability. One study suggests that
missing, wrong, and otherwise bad data cost U.S. firms billions of
dollars annually. The consequences of bad data include improper billing,
cost overruns, delivery delays, and product recalls. Because data
accuracy is so critical, organizations need to be watchful when
capturing data---the point at which data accuracy is most vulnerable.

##### Timely {-}

The value of a collection of data is often determined by its age. You
can fantasize about how rich you would be if you knew tomorrow's stock
prices. Although decision makers are most interested in current data,
the required currency of data can vary with the task. Operational
managers often want real-time data. They want to tap the pulse of the
production line so that they can react quickly to machine breakdowns or
quality slippages. In contrast, strategic planners might be content with
data that are months old because they are more concerned with detecting
long-term trends.

##### Relevant {-}

Organizations must maintain data that are relevant to transaction
processing and decision making. In processing a credit card application,
the most relevant data might be the customer's credit history, current
employment status, and income level. Hair color would be irrelevant.
When assessing the success of a new product line, a marketing manager
probably wants an aggregate report of sales by marketing region. A
voluminous report detailing every sale would be irrelevant. Data are
relevant when they pertain directly to the decision and are aggregated
appropriately.

Relevance is a key concern in designing a data management system.
Clients have to decide what should be stored because it is pertinent now
or could have future relevance. Of course, identifying data that might
be relevant in the future is difficult, and there is a tendency to
accumulate too much. Relevance is also an important consideration when
extracting and processing data from a data management system. Provided
the germane data are available, query languages can be used to aggregate
data appropriately.

In the final years of the twentieth century, organizations started to
share much of their data, both high and low volatility, via the Web.
This move increased shareability, timeliness, and availability, and it
has lowered the cost of distributing data.

In summary, a data management system for maintaining an organization's
memory supports transaction processing, remembering the past, and
decision making. Its contents must be shareable, secure, and accurate.
Ideally, the clients of a data management system must be able to get
timely and relevant data when and where required. A major challenge for
data management professionals is to create data management systems that
meet these criteria. Unfortunately, many existing systems fail in this
regard, though we can understand some of the reasons why by reviewing
the components of existing organizational memory systems.

#### Components of organizational memory {-}

An organization's memory resides on a variety of media in a variety of
ways. It is in people, standard operating procedures, roles,
organizational culture, physical storage equipment, and electronic
devices. It is scattered around the organization like pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle designed by a berserk artist. The pieces don't fit together, they
sometimes overlap, there are gaps, and there are no edge pieces to
define the boundaries. Organizations struggle to design structures and
use data management technology to link some of the pieces. To understand
the complexity of this wicked puzzle, we need to examine some of the
pieces. Data managers have a particular need to understand the different
forms of organizational memory because their activities often influence
a number of the components.

*Components of organizational memory*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/org memory components.jpg)

##### People {-}

People are the linchpin of an organization's memory. They recall prior
decisions and business actions. They create, maintain, evolve, and use
data management systems. They are the major component of an
organization's memory because they know how to use many of the other
components. People extract data from the various elements of
organizational memory to provide as complete a picture of a situation as
possible.

Each person in an organization has a role and a position in the
hierarchy. Role and position are both devices for remembering how the
organization functions and how to process data. By labeling people
(e.g., Chief Information Officer) and placing their names on an
organizational chart, the organization creates another form of
organizational memory.

Organizational culture is the shared beliefs, values, attitudes, and
norms that influence the behavior and expectations of each person in an
organization. As a long-lived and stable memory system, culture
determines acceptable behavior and influences decision making.

People develop skills for doing their particular job---learning what to
do, how to do it, and who can help them get things done. For example,
they might discover someone in employee benefits who can handle
personnel problems or a contact in a software company who can answer
questions promptly. These social networks, which often take years to
develop, are used to make things happen and to learn about the business
environment. Despite their high value, they are rarely documented, at
least not beyond an address book, and they are typically lost when a
person leaves an organization.

**Conversations** are an important method for knowledge workers to
create, modify, and share organizational memory and to build
relationships and social networks. Discussions with customers are a key
device for learning how to improve an organization's products and
services and learning about competitors. The ***conversational
company*** can detect change faster and react more rapidly. The
telephone, instant message, e-mail, coffee machine, cocktail hour, and
cafeteria are all devices for promoting conversation and creating
networks. Some firms deliberately create structures for supporting
dialog to make the people component of organizational memory more
effective.

Standard operating procedures exist for many organizational tasks.
Processing a credit application, selecting a marketing trainee, and
preparing a departmental budget are typical procedures that are clearly
defined by many organizations. They are described on Web pages, computer
programs, and job specifications. They are the way an organization
remembers how to perform routine activities.

Successful people learn how to use organizational memory. They learn
what data are stored where, how to retrieve them, and how to put them
together. In promoting a new product, a salesperson might send the
prospect a package containing some brochures and an email of a product
review in a trade journal, and supply the phone number and e-mail
address of the firm's technical expert for that product. People's recall
of how to use organizational memory is the core component of
organizational memory. Academics call this **metamemory**; people in
business call it ***l**earning the ropes*. New employees spend a great
deal of time building their metamemory so that they can use
organizational memory effectively. Without this knowledge,
organizational memory has little value.

##### Tables {-}

A table is a common form of storing organizational data. The following
table shows a price list in tabular form. Often, the first row defines
the meaning of data in subsequent rows.

*A price list*

  Product                 Price
  ----------------------- -------
  Pocket knife--Nile      4.5
  Compass                 10
  Geopositioning system   500
  Map measure             4.9

A table is a general form that describes a variety of other structures
used to store data. Computer-based files are tables or can be
transformed into tables; the same is true for general ledgers,
worksheets, and spreadsheets. Accounting systems make frequent use of
tables. As you will discover in the next section, the table is the
central structure of the relational database model.

Data stored in tables typically have certain characteristics:

* Data in one column are of the same type. For example, each cell of the
column headed "Price" contains a number. (Of course, the exception is
the first row of each column, which contains the title of the column.)

* Data are limited by the width of the available space.

Rapid searching is one of the prime advantages of a table. For example,
if the price list is sorted by product name, you can quickly find the
price of any product.

Tables are a common form of storing organizational data because their
structure is readily understood. People learn to read and build tables
in the early years of their schooling. Also, a great deal of the data
that organizations want to remember can be stored in tabular form.

##### Documets {-}

The **document**---of which reports, manuals, brochures, and memos are
examples---is a common medium for storing organizational data. Although
documents may be subdivided into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and
sentences, they lack the regularity and discipline of a table. Each row
of a table has the same number of columns, but each paragraph of a
document does not have the same number of sentences.

Most documents are now stored electronically. Because of the widespread
use of word processing, text files are a common means of storing
documents. Typically, such files are read sequentially like a book.
Although there is support for limited searching of the text, such as
finding the next occurrence of a specified text string, text files are
usually processed linearly.

Hypertext, the familiar linking technology of the Web, supports
nonlinear document processing. A hypertext document has built-in
linkages between sections of text that permit the reader to jump quickly
from one part to another. As a result, readers can find data they
require more rapidly.

Although hypertext is certainly more reader-friendly than a flat,
sequential text file, it takes time and expertise to establish the links
between the various parts of the text and to other documents. Someone
familiar with the topic has to decide what should be linked and then
establish these links. While it takes the author more time to prepare a
document this way, the payoff is the speed at which readers of the
document can find what they want.

##### Multimedia {-}

Many Web sites display multimedia objects, such as sound and video
clips. Automotive company Web sites have video clips of cars, music
outlets provide sound clips of new releases, and clothing companies have
online catalogs displaying photos of their latest products. Maintaining
a Web site, because of the many multimedia objects that some sites
contain, has become a significant data management problem for some
organizations. Consider the different types of data that a news outfit
such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has to store to
provide a timely, informative, and engaging Web site.

##### Images {-}

Images are visual data: photographs and sketches. Image banks are
maintained for several reasons. *First**, ***images are widely used for
identification and security. Police departments keep fingerprints and
mug shots. *Second*, images are used as evidence. Highly valuable items
such as paintings and jewelry often are photographed for insurance
records. *Third*, images are used for advertising and promotional
campaigns, and organizations need to maintain records of material used
in these ventures. Image archiving and retrieval are essential for
mail-order companies, which often produce several photo-laden catalogs
every year. *Fourth*, some organizations specialize in selling images
and maintain extensive libraries of clip art and photographs.

##### Graphics {-}

Maps and engineering drawings are examples of electronically stored
graphics. An organization might maintain a map of sales territories and
customers. Manufacturers have extensive libraries of engineering
drawings that define the products they produce. Graphics often contain a
high level of detail. An engineering drawing will define the dimensions
of all parts and may refer to other drawings for finer detail about any
components.

A graphic differs from an image in that it contains explicitly embedded
data. Consider the difference between an engineering plan for a widget
and a photograph of the same item. An engineering plan shows dimensional
data and may describe the composition of the various components. The
embedded data are used to manufacture the widget. A photograph of a
widget does not have embedded data and contains insufficient data to
manufacture the product. An industrial spy will receive far more for an
engineering plan than for a photograph of a widget.

A geographic information systems **(**GIS**)** is a specialized
graphical storage system for geographic data. The underlying structure
of a GIS is a map on which data are displayed. A power company can use a
GIS to store and display data about its electricity grid and the
location of transformers. Using a pointing device such as a mouse, an
engineer can click on a transformer's location to display a window of
data about the transformer (e.g., type, capacity, installation date, and
repair history). GISs have found widespread use in governments and
organizations that have geographically dispersed resources.

##### Audio {-}

News organizations, such as National Public Radio (NPR), provide audio
versions of their new stories for replay. Some firms conduct a great
deal of their business by phone. In many cases, it is important to
maintain a record of the conversation between the customer and the
firm's representative. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, which covers
horse racing gambling in Hong Kong, records all conversations between
its operators and customers. Phone calls are stored on a highly
specialized voice recorder, which records the time of the call and other
data necessary for rapid retrieval. In the case of a customer dispute,
an operator can play back the original conversation.

##### Video {-}

A video clip can give a potential customer additional detail that cannot
be readily conveyed by text or a still image. Consequently, some auto
companies use video and virtual reality to promote their cars. On a
visit to Toyota's Web site, you can view video clips of the latest
models or rotate an image to view a car from multiple angles.

##### Models {-}

Organizations build mathematical models to describe their business.
These models, usually placed in the broader category of DSS, are then
used to analyze existing problems and forecast future business
conditions. A mathematical model can often produce substantial benefits
to the organization.

##### Knowledge {-}

Organizations build systems to capture the knowledge of their
experienced decision makers and problem solvers. This expertise is
typically represented as a set of rules, semantic nets, and frames in a
knowledge base, another form of organizational memory.

##### Decisions {-}

Decision making is the central activity of modern organizations. Very
few organizations, however, have a formal system for recording
decisions. Most keep the minutes of meetings, but these are often very
brief and record only a meeting's outcome. Because they do not record
details such as the objectives, criteria, assumptions, and alternatives
that were considered prior to making a decision, there is no formal
audit trail for decision making. As a result, most organizations rely on
humans to remember the circumstances and details of prior decisions.

##### Specialized memories {-}

Because of the particular nature of their business, some organizations
maintain memories rarely found elsewhere. Perfume companies, for
instance, maintain a library of scents, and paint manufacturers and dye
makers catalog colors.

#### Components of organizational memory {-}

Organizations are not limited to their own memory stores. There are
firms whose business is to store data for resale to other organizations.
Such businesses have existed for many years and are growing as the
importance of data in a postindustrial society expands. U.S. lawyers can
use document management services to access the laws and court decisions
of all 50 American states and the U.S. federal government. Similar legal
data services exist in many other nations. There is a range of other
services that provide news, financial, business, scientific, and medical
data.

### Problems with data management systems {-}

Successful management of data is a critical skill for nearly every
organization. Yet few have gained complete mastery, and there are a
variety of problems that typically afflict data management in most
firms.

*Problems with organizational data management systems*

  Redundancy                 Same data are stored in different systems
  -------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Lack of data control       Data are poorly managed
  Poor interface             Data are difficult to access
  Delays                     There are frequently delays following requests for reports
  Lack of reality            Data management systems do not reflect the complexity of the real world
  Lack of data integration   Data are dispersed across different systems

#### Redundancy {-}

In many cases, data management systems have grown haphazardly. As a
result, it is often the situation that the same data are stored in
several different memories. The classic example is a customer's address,
which might be stored in the sales reporting system, accounts receivable
system, and the salesperson's address book. The danger is that when the
customer changes address, the alteration is not recorded in all systems.
Data redundancy causes additional work because the same item must be
entered several times. Redundancy causes confusion when what is
supposedly the same item has different values.

#### Lack of data control {-}

Allied with the redundancy problem is poor data control. Although data
are an important organizational resource, they frequently do not receive
the same degree of management attention as other important
organizational resources, such as people and money. Organizations have a
personnel department to manage human resources and a treasury to handle
cash. The IS department looks after data captured by the computer
systems it operates, but there are many other data stores scattered
around the organization. Data are stored everywhere in the organization
(e.g., on personal computers and departmental servers), but there is a
general lack of data management. This lack is particularly surprising,
since many pundits claim that data are a key competitive resource.

#### Poor interface {-}

Too frequently, the potential clients of data management systems have
been deterred by an unfriendly interface. The computer interface for
accessing a data store is sometimes difficult to remember for the
occasional inquirer. People become frustrated and give up because their
queries are rejected and error messages are unintelligible.

#### Delays {-}

Globalization and technology have accelerated the pace of business in
recent years. Managers must make more decisions more rapidly. They
cannot afford to wait for programmers to write special-purpose programs
to retrieve data and format reports. They expect their questions to be
answered rapidly, often within an hour and sometimes more quickly.
Managers, or their support personnel, need query languages that provide
rapid access to the data they need, in a format that they want.

#### Lack of reality {-}

Organizational data stores must reflect the reality and complexity of
the real world. Consider a typical bank customer who might have a
personal checking account, mortgage account, credit card account, and
some certificates of deposit. When a customer requests an overdraft
extension, the bank officer needs full details of the customer's
relationship with the bank to make an informed decision. If customer
data are scattered across unrelated data stores, then these data are not
easily found, and in some cases important data might be overlooked. The
request for full customer details is reasonable and realistic, and the
bank officer should expect to be able to enter a single query to obtain
it. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, because data management
systems do not always reflect reality.

In this example, the reality is that the personal checking, mortgage,
and credit card accounts, and certificates of deposit all belong to one
customer. If the bank's data management system does not record this
relationship, then it does not mimic reality. This makes it impossible
to retrieve a single customer's data with a single query.

A data management system must meet the decision making needs of
managers, who must be able to request both routine and ad hoc reports.
To do so effectively, a data management system must reflect the
complexity of the real world. If it does not store required
organizational data or record a real-world relationship between data
elements, then some managerial queries might not be answerable quickly.

#### Lack of data integration {-}

There is a general lack of data integration in most organizations. Not
only are data dispersed in different forms of organizational memory
(e.g., files and image stores), but even within one storage format there
is often a lack of integration. For example, many organizations maintain
file systems that are not integrated. Appropriate files in the
accounting system may not be linked to the production system.

This lack of integration will be a continuing problem for most
organizations for two important reasons. ***First,*** earlier computer
systems might not have been integrated because of the limitations of
available technology. Organizations created simple file systems to
support a particular function. Many of these systems are still in use.
***Second***, integration is a long-term goal. As new systems are
developed and old ones rewritten, organizations can evolve integrated
systems. It would be too costly and disruptive to try to solve the data
integration problem in one step.

Many data management problems can be solved with present technology.
Data modeling and relational database technology, topics covered in
Section 2, help overcome many of the current problems.

### A brief history of data management systems {-}

Data management is not a new organizational concern. It is an old
problem that has become more significant, important, and critical
because of the emergence of data as a critical resource for effective
performance in the modern economy. Organizations have always needed to
manage their data so that they could remember a wide variety of facts
necessary to conduct their affairs. The recent history of computer-based
data management systems is depicted in the following figure.

*Data management systems timeline*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/timeline2.png)

File systems were the earliest form of data management. Limited by the
sequential nature of magnetic tape technology, it was very difficult to
integrate data from different files. The advent of magnetic disk
technology in the mid-1950s stimulated development of integrated file
systems, and the hierarchical database management system (DBMS) emerged
in the 1960s, followed some years later by the network DBMS. The spatial
database, or geographic information system (GIS), appeared around 1970.
Until the mid-1990s, the hierarchical DBMS, mainly in the form of IBM's
DL/I product, was the predominant technology for managing data. It has
now been replaced by the relational DBMS, a concept first discussed by
Edgar Frank Codd in an academic paper in 1970 but not commercially
available until the mid-1970s. In the late 1980s, the notion of an
object-oriented DBMS, primed by the ideas of object-oriented
programming, emerged as a solution to situations not handled well by the
relational DBMS. Also around this time, the idea of modeling a database
as a graph was introduced. Towards the end of the 20th century, XML was
developed for exchanging data between computers, and it can also be used
as a data store as you will learn in section 3. More recently, the
Hadoop distributed files system (HDFS) has emerged as a popular
alternative model for data management, and it will be covered in the
latter part of this book. Other recent data management systems include
graph and NoSQL databases. While these are beyond the scope of an
introductory data management text, if you decided to pursue a career in
data management you should learn about their advantages and the
applications to which they are well-suited. For example, graph databases
are a good fit for the analysis of social networks.

This book concentrates on the relational model, currently the most
widely used data management system. As mentioned, Section 2 is devoted
to the development of the necessary skills for designing and using a
relational database.

### Data, information, and knowledge {-}

Often the terms ***data*** and ***information*** are used
interchangeably, but they are distinctly different. Data are raw,
unsummarized, and unanalyzed facts. Information is data that have been
processed into a meaningful form.

A list of a supermarket's daily receipts is data, but it is not
information, because it is too detailed to be very useful. A summary of
the data that gives daily departmental totals is information, because
the store manager can use the report to monitor store performance. The
same report might be data for a regional manager, because it is too
detailed for meaningful decision making at the regional level.
Information for a regional manager might be a weekly report of sales by
department for each supermarket.

Data are always data, but one person's information can be another
person's data. Information that is meaningful to one person can be too
detailed for another. A manager's notion of information can change
quickly, however. When a problem is identified, a manager might request
finer levels of detail to diagnose the problem's cause. Thus, what was
previously data suddenly becomes information because it helps solve the
problem. When the problem is solved, the information reverts to data.
There is a need for information systems that let managers customize the
processing of data so that they always get information. As their needs
change, they need to be able to adjust the detail of the reports they
receive.

Knowledge is the capacity to use information. The education and
experience that managers accumulate provide them with the expertise to
make sense of the information they receive. Knowledge means that
managers can interpret information and use it in decision making. In
addition, knowledge is the capacity to recognize what information would
be useful for making decisions. For example, a sales manager might know
that requesting a report of profitability by product line is useful when
she has to decide whether to employ a new product manager. Thus, when a
new information system is delivered, managers need to be taught what
information the system can deliver and what that information means.

The relationship between data, information, and knowledge is depicted in
the following figure. A knowledgeable person requests information to
support decision making. To fulfill the request, data are converted into
information. Personal knowledge is then applied to interpret the
requested information and reach a conclusion. Of course, the cycle can
be repeated several times if more information is needed before a
decision can be made. Notice how knowledge is essential for grasping
what information to request and interpreting that information in terms
of the required decision.

*The relationship between data, information, and knowledge*

![](Figures/Chapter 1/data-info-know.jpg)

### The challenge {-}

A major challenge facing organizations is to make effective use of the
data currently stored in their diverse data management systems. This
challenge exists because these various systems are not integrated and
many potential clients not only lack the training to access the systems
but often are unaware what data exist. Before data managers can begin to
address this problem, however, they must understand how organizational
memories are used. In particular, they need to understand the
relationship between information and managerial decision making. Data
management is not a new problem. It has existed since the early days of
civilization and will be an enduring problem for organizations and
societies.

![](Figures/Chapter 1/expeditioner.png) 

Alice Lindsay was enjoying the 
luxuries of first-class travel. It was quite a change from being an 
undergraduate student of business. She was enjoying her filet mignon 
and glass of shiraz. Good riddance to pizzas, hamburgers, and subs! 
Hello to fine food and gourmet restaurants! With her newly found wealth, 
she could travel in style and enjoy the very best restaurants. Alice, or 
Lady Alice to be more precise, had recently inherited a title, a valuable 
portfolio of stocks, and The Expeditioner. Her good fortune had coincided 
with the completion of her business degree. Now, instead of looking for a 
job, the job had found her: She was chair and managing director of The 
Expeditioner.

The Expeditioner is in a nineteenth-century building in Explorers Lane,
opposite Kensington Gardens and just a stone's throw from the Royal
Geographical Society. Founded in the Middle Ages, The Expeditioner has a
long history of equipping explorers, adventurers, and travelers. Its
initial success was due to its development of a light, flexible chain
mail armor. It did very well during the Middle Ages, when highway
robbery was a growth business and travelers sought protection from the
arrows and slings aimed at their fortunes. The branch office at the
entrance to Sherwood Forest had done exceptionally well, thanks to its
passing wealthy clientele. The resident company wit, one Ned Thomas,
often claims that "The Expeditioner was the first mail order company."

The Expeditioner's customers included the famous and the legendary.
Orders from Marco Polo, Columbus, Magellan, Cook, and Livingston can be
found in the ledgers. The most long-lived customer is a Mr. Walker,^3^
who for several hundred years has had a standing yearly order of one
roll of purple, premium-quality, non-rip, jungle twill. The
Expeditioner's hats are very popular with a Mr. I. Jones, an American.

The nineteenth century was one long boom for The Expeditioner, the
supplier de rigueur for the guardians of the European colonies. Branch
offices were opened in Bombay, Sydney, Cape Town, and Singapore. For a
generous fee, cad and renowned adventurer Harry Flashman^4^ assiduously
promoted The Expeditioner's wares on his many trips. As a result, orders
poured in from the four corners of the globe. The Expeditioner's catalog
was found in polite society and clubs throughout the British Empire.

The founder of The Expeditioner was a venturesome Scot who sought his
fortune in London. Carefully guarding the family business, The
Expeditioner's proprietors were inclined to be closefisted and invested
their massive profits wisely. Because of their close contacts with many
explorers, they made some very canny investments in mining ventures in
distant lands. As a result, when business contracted during the
twentieth century, the investment portfolio kept the company solvent.
Traditionally, ownership of the firm was inherited by the eldest child.
When the most recent owner, a bachelor, died, the firm's lawyers spent
months on genealogical research to identify the legal heir.

Alice had vivid memories of the day when Mr. Mainwaring phoned her to
request an appointment. As she did not recognize the caller, she let the
message go to voicemail. She remembered listening to it several times
because she was intrigued by both the unusual accent and the message. It
sounded something like, "Good afternoon, Lady Alice, I am Nigel
Mannering of Chumli, Crepiny, Marchbanks, and Sinjun. If you would like
to hear news to your advantage, please contact me."

Two days later, Alice met with Nigel. This also had been most memorable.
The opening conversation had been confusing. He started with the very
same formal introduction, "Good afternoon, Lady Alice, I am Nigel
Mannering of Chumli, Crepiny, Marchbanks, and Sinjun. I am pleased to
meet you," and handed Alice his card. Alice quickly inspected the card,
which read, "Nigel Mainwaring, LL. B., Cholmondeley, Crespigny,
Majoribanks, and St. John," but he had said nothing like that. She
thought, "What planet is this guy from?"^5^

It took fifteen minutes for Alice to discover that British English was
not quite the same as American English. She quickly learned---or should
that be "learnt?"---that many proper English names have a traditional
pronunciation not easily inferred from the spelling. Once this names'
problem had been sorted out, Nigel told Alice of her good fortune. She
was the new owner of The Expeditioner. She also inherited the title that
had been conferred on a previous owner by a grateful monarch who had
been equipped by The Expeditioner for traveling in the Australian
outback. She was now entitled to be called "Lady Alice of Bullamakanka."
Nigel was in a bit of a rush. He left Alice with a first-class ticket to
London and an attaché case of folders, and with an effusive "Jolly good
show," disappeared.

### Summary {-}

Organizations must maintain a memory to process transactions and make
decisions. Organizational data should be shareable, transportable,
secure, and accurate, and provide timely, relevant information. The
essential components are people (the most important), text, multimedia
data, models, and knowledge. A wide variety of technologies can be used
to manage data. External memories enlarge the range of data available to
an organization. Data management systems often have some major
shortcomings: redundancy, poor data control, poor interfaces, long lead
times for query resolution, an inability to supply answers for questions
posed by managers, and poor data integration. Data are raw facts;
information is data processed into a meaningful form. Knowledge is the
capacity to use information.

* be able to describe the various roles of information in organizational
change;

* be able to distinguish between soft and hard information;

* know how managers use information;

* be able to describe the characteristics of common information delivery
systems;

* distinguish the different types of knowledge.

### Introduction {-}

There are three characteristics of the early decades of the twenty-first
century: global warming, high-velocity global change, and the emerging
power of information organizations.^6^ he need to create a sustainable
civilization, the globalization of business, and the rise of China as a
major economic power are major forces contributing to mass change.
Organizations are undergoing large-scale restructuring as they attempt
to reposition themselves to survive the threats and exploit the
opportunities presented by these changes.

In the last few years, some very powerful and highly profitable
information-based organizations have emerged. Apple is the world's
largest company in terms of market value. Leveraging the iPhone and IOS,
it has shown the power of information services to change an industry.
Google has become a well-known global brand as it fulfills its mission
"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible
and useful." Amazon is disrupting traditional retail. Facebook has
digitized our social world, and Microsoft has dominated the office
environment for decades. We gain further insights into the value of
information by considering its role in civilization.

### A historical perspective {-}

Humans have been collecting data to manage their affairs for several
thousand years. In 3000 BCE, Mesopotamians recorded inventory details in
cuneiform, an early script. Today\'s society transmits Exabytes of data
every day as billions of people and millions of organizations manage
their affairs. The dominant issue facing each type of economy has
changed over time, and the collection and use of data has changed to
reflect these concerns, as shown in the following table.

*Societal focus*

![](Figures/Chapter 2/societal focus.png) 

Agrarian society was concerned with productive farming, and an important
issue was when to plant crops. Ancient Egypt, for example, based its
calendar on the flooding of the Nile. The focus shifted during the
industrial era to management of resources (e.g., raw materials, labor,
logistics). Accounting, ERP, and project management became key
information systems for managing resources. In the current service
economy, the focus has shifted to customer creation. There is an
oversupply of many consumer products (e.g., cars) and companies compete
to identify services and product features that will attract customers.
They are concerned with determining what types of customers to recruit
and finding out what they want. As a result, we have seen the rise of
business analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) to address
this dominant issue. As well as creating customers, firms need to serve
those already recruited. High quality service often requires frequent
and reliable execution of multiple processes during manifold encounters
with customers by a firm's many customer facing employees (e.g., a fast
food store, an airline, a hospital). Consequently, business process
management (BPM) has grown in importance since the mid 1990s when there
was a surge of interest in business process reengineering.

We are in transition to a new era, sustainability, where attention
shifts to assessing environmental impact because, after several
centuries of industrialization, atmospheric CO~2~ levels have become
alarmingly high. We are also reaching the limits of the planet's
resources as its population now exceeds seven billion people. As a
result, a new class of application is emerging, such as environmental
management systems and UPS\'s telematics project.^7^ These new systems
will also include, for example, support for understanding environmental
impact through simulation of energy consuming and production systems,
optimization of energy systems, and design of low impact production and
customer service systems. Notice that dominant issues don't disappear
but rather aggregate in layers, so tomorrow's business will be concerned
with survival, production, customer service, and sustainability. As a
result, a firm's need for data never diminishes, and each new layer
creates another set of data needs. The flood will not subside and for
most firms the data flow will need to grow significantly to meet the new
challenge of sustainability.

A constant across all of these economies is organizational memory, or in
its larger form, social memory. Writing and paper manufacturing
developed about the same time as agricultural societies. Limited writing
systems appeared about 30,000 years ago. Full writing systems, which
have evolved in the last 5,000 years, made possible the technological
transfer that enabled humanity to move from hunting and gathering to
farming. Writing enables the recording of knowledge, and information can
accumulate from one generation to the next. Before writing, knowledge
was confined by the limits of human memory.

There is a need for a technology that can store knowledge for extended
periods and support transport of written information. Storage medium has
advanced from clay tablets (4000 BCE), papyrus (3500 BCE), and parchment
(2000 BCE) to paper (100 CE.). Written knowledge gained great impetus
from Johannes Gutenberg, whose achievement was a printing system
involving movable metal type, ink, paper, and press. In less than 50
years, printing technology diffused throughout most of Europe. In the
last century, a range of new storage media appeared (e.g., photographic,
magnetic, and optical).

Organizational memories emerged with the development of large
organizations such as governments, armies, churches, and trading
companies. The growth of organizations during the industrial revolution
saw a massive increase in the number and size of organizational
memories. This escalation continued throughout the twentieth century.

The Internet has demonstrated that we now live in a borderless world.
There is a free flow of information, investment, and industry across
borders. Customers ignore national boundaries to buy products and
services. In the borderless information age, the old ways of creating
wealth have been displaced by intelligence, marketing, global reach, and
education. Excelling in the management of data, information, and
knowledge has become a prerequisite to corporate and national wealth.

*Wealth creation*

  ------------------- --------------
  Military power      Intelligence
  Natural resources   Marketing
  Population          Global reach
  Industry            Education

This brief history shows the increasing importance of information.
Civilization was facilitated by the discovery of means for recording and
disseminating information. In our current society, organizations are the
predominant keepers and transmitters of information.

### A brief history of information systems {-}

Information systems has three significant eras. In the first era,
information work was transported to the computer. For instance, a
punched card deck was physically transported to a computer center, the
information was processed, and the output physically returned to the
worker as a printout.

*Information systems eras*

In the second era, private networks were used to take information work
to the employee. Initially, these were time-sharing and host/terminal
systems. IS departments were concerned primarily with creating systems
for use by an organization's employees when interacting with customers
(e.g., a hotel reservation system used by call center employees) or for
the employees of another business to transact with the organization
(e.g., clerks in a hospital ordering supplies).

Era 3 starts with the appearance of the Web browser in the mid-1990s.
The browser, which can be used on the public and global Internet,
permits organizations to take information and information work to
customers and other stakeholders. Now, the customer undertakes work
previously done by the organization (e.g., making an airline
reservation).

The scale and complexity of era 3 is at least an order of magnitude
greater than that of era 2. Nearly every company has far more customers
than employees. For example, UPS, with an annual investment of more than
\$1 billion in information technology and over 400,000 employees, is one
of the world's largest employers. However, there are 11 million
customers, over 25 times the number of employees, who are today
electronically connected to UPS.

Era 3 introduced direct electronic links between a firm and its
stakeholders, such as investors and citizens. In the earlier eras,
intermediaries often communicated with stakeholders on behalf of the
firm (e.g., a press release to the news media). These messages could be
filtered and edited, or sometimes possibly ignored, by intermediaries.
Now, organizations can communicate directly with their stakeholders via
the Web, e-mail, social media. Internet technologies offer firms a
chance to rethink their goals vis-à-vis each stakeholder class and to
use Internet technology to pursue these goals.

This brief history leads to the conclusion that the value IS creates is
determined by whom an organization can reach, how it can reach them, and
where and when it can reach them.

* **Whom**. Whom an organization can contact determines whom it can
influence, inform, or transfer work to. For example, if a hotel can be
contacted electronically by its customers, it can promote online
reservations (transfer work to customers), and reduce its costs.

* **How**. How an organization reaches a stakeholder determines the
potential success of the interaction. The higher the bandwidth of the
connection, the richer the message (e.g., using video instead of text),
the greater the amount of information that can be conveyed, and the more
information work that can be transferred.

* **Where**. Value is created when customers get information directly
related to their current location (e.g., a navigation system) and what
local services they want to consume (e.g., the nearest Italian
restaurant).

* **When**. When a firm delivers a service to a client can greatly
determine its value. Stockbrokers, for instance, who can inform clients
immediately of critical corporate news or stock market movements are
likely to get more business.

### Information characteristics {-}

Three useful concepts for describing information are hardness, richness,
and class. Information hardness is a subjective measure of the accuracy
and reliability of an item of information. Information richness
describes the concept that information can be rich or lean depending on
the information delivery medium. Information class groups types of
information by their key features.

#### Information hardness {-}

In 1812, the Austrian mineralogist Friedrich Mohs proposed a scale of
hardness, in order of increasing relative hardness, based on 10 common
minerals. Each mineral can scratch those with the same or a lower
number, but cannot scratch higher-numbered minerals.

A similar approach can be used to describe information. Market
information, such as the current price of gold, is the hardest because
it is measured extremely accurately. There is no ambiguity, and its
measurement is highly reliable. In contrast, the softest information,
which comes from unidentified sources, is rife with uncertainty.

*An information hardness scale*

  Mineral      Scale   Data
  ------------ ------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Talc         1       Unidentified source---rumors, gossip, and hearsay
  Gypsum       2       Identified non-expert source---opinions, feelings, and ideas
  Calcite      3       Identified expert source---predictions, speculations, forecasts, and estimates
  Fluorite     4       Unsworn testimony---explanations, justifications, assessments, and interpretations
  Apatite      5       Sworn testimony---explanations, justifications, assessments, and interpretations
  Orthoclase   6       Budgets, formal plans
  Quartz       7       News reports, non-financial data, industry statistics, and surveys
  Topaz        8       Unaudited financial statements, and government statistics
  Corundum     9       Audited financial statements
  Diamond      10      Stock exchange and commodity market data

Audited financial statements are in the corundum zone. They are measured
according to standard rules (known as "generally accepted accounting
principles") that are promulgated by national accounting societies.
External auditors monitor the application of these standards, although
there is generally some leeway in their application and sometimes
multiple standards for the same item. The use of different accounting
principles can lead to different profit and loss statements. As a
result, the information in audited financial statements has some degree
of uncertainty.

There are degrees of hardness within accounting systems. The hardest
data are counts, such as units sold or customers served. These are
primary measures of organizational performance. Secondary measures, such
as dollar sales and market share, are derived from counts. Managers vary
in their preference for primary and secondary measures. Operational
managers opt for counts for measuring productivity because they are
uncontaminated by price changes and currency fluctuations. Senior
managers, because their focus is on financial performance, select
secondary measures.

The scratch test provides a convenient and reliable method of assessing
the hardness of a mineral. Unfortunately, there is no scratch test for
information. Managers must rely on their judgment to assess information
hardness.

Although managers want hard information, there are many cases when it is
not available. They compensate by seeking information from several
different sources. Although this approach introduces redundancy, this is
precisely what the manager seeks. Relatively consistent information from
different sources is reassuring.

#### Information richness {-}

Information can be described as rich or lean. It is richest when
delivered face-to-face. Conversation permits immediate feedback for
verification of meaning. You can always stop the other speaker and ask,
"What do you mean?" Face-to-face information delivery is rich because
you see the speaker's body language, hear the tone of voice, and natural
language is used. A numeric document is the leanest form of information.
There is no opportunity for questions, no additional information from
body movements and vocal tone. The information richness of some
communication media is shown in the following table.

*Information richness and communication media^8^*

  Richest                                                                        Leanest
  -------------- ----------- -------------------- ------------------------------ -------------------
  Face-to-face   Telephone   Personal documents   Impersonal written documents   Numeric documents

Managers seek rich information when they are trying to resolve
equivocality or ambiguity. It means that managers cannot make sense of a
situation because they arrive at multiple, conflicting interpretations
of the information. An example of an equivocal situation is a class
assignment where some of the instructions are missing and others are
contradictory (of course, this example is an extremely rare event).

Equivocal situations cannot be resolved by collecting more information,
because managers are uncertain about what questions to ask and often a
clear answer is not possible. Managers reduce equivocality by sharing
their interpretations of the available information and reaching a
collective understanding of what the information means. By exchanging
opinions and recalling their experiences, they try to make sense of an
ambiguous situation.

Many of the situations that managers face each day involve a high degree
of equivocality. Formal organizational memories, such as databases, are
not much help, because the information they provide is lean. Many
managers rely far more on talking with colleagues and using informal
organizational memories such as social networks.

Data management is almost exclusively concerned with administering the
formal information systems that deliver lean information. Although this
is their proper role, data managers must realize that they can deliver
only a portion of the data required by decision makers.

#### Information classes {-}

Information can be grouped into four classes: content, form, behavior,
and action. Until recently, most organizational information fell into
the first category.

*Information classes*

  Class      Description
  ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  Content    Quantity, location, and types of items
  Form       Shape and composition of an object
  Behavior   Simulation of a physical object
  Action     Creation of action (e.g., industrial robots)

Content information records details about quantity, location, and types
of items. It tends to be historical in nature and is traditionally the
class of information collected and stored by organizations. The content
information of a car would describe its model number, color, price,
options, horsepower, and so forth. Hundreds of bytes of data may be
required to record the full content information of a car. Typically,
content data are captured by a TPS.

Form information describes the shape and composition of an object. For
example, the form information of a car would define the dimensions and
composition of every component in the car. Millions of bytes of data are
needed to store the form of a car. CAD/CAM systems are used to create
and store form information.

Behavior information is used to predict the behavior of a physical
object using simulation techniques, which typically require form
information as input. Massive numbers of calculations per second are
required to simulate behavior. For example, simulating the flight of a
new aircraft design may require trillions of computations. Behavior
information is often presented visually because the vast volume of data
generated cannot be easily processed by humans in other formats.

Action information enables the instantaneous creation of sophisticated
action. Industrial robots take action information and manufacture parts,
weld car bodies, or transport items. Antilock brakes are an example of
action information in use.

### Information and organizational change {-}

Organizations are goal-directed. They undergo continual change as they
use their resources, people, technology, and financial assets to reach
some future desired outcome. Goals are often clearly stated, such as to
make a profit of \$100 million, win a football championship, or decrease
the government deficit by 25 percent in five years. Goals are often not
easily achieved, however, and organizations continually seek information
that supports goal attainment. The information they seek falls into
three categories: goal setting, gap, and change.

*Organizational information categories*

![](Figures/Chapter 2/gap model.jpg) 

The emergence of an information society also means that information
provides dual possibilities for change. Information is used to plan
change, and information is a medium for change.

#### Goal-setting information {-}

Organizations set goals or levels of desired performance. Managers need
information to establish goals that are challenging but realistic. A
common approach is to take the previous goal and stretch it. For
example, a company with a 15 percent return on investment (ROI) might
set the new goal at 17 percent ROI. This technique is known as
"anchoring and adjusting." Prior performance is used as a basis for
setting the new performance standards. The problem with anchoring and
adjusting is that it promotes incremental improvement rather than
radical change because internal information is used to set performance
standards. Some organizations have turned to external information and
are using benchmarking as a source of information for goal setting.

##### Planning {-}

Planning is an important task for senior managers. To set the direction
for the company, they need information about consumers' potential
demands and social, economic, technical, and political conditions. They
use this information to determine the opportunities and threats facing
the organization, thus permitting them to take advantage of
opportunities and avoid threats.

Most of the information for long-term planning comes from sources
external to the company. There are think tanks that analyze trends and
publish reports on future conditions. Journal articles and books can be
important sources of information about future events. There also will be
a demand for some internal information to identify trends in costs and
revenues. Major planning decisions, such as building a new plant, will
be based on an analysis of internal data (use of existing capacity) and
external data (projected customer demand).

##### Benchmarking {-}

Benchmarking establishes goals based on best industry practices. It is
founded on the Japanese concept of *dantotsu*, striving to be the best
of the best. Benchmarking is externally directed. Information is sought
on those companies, regardless of industry, that demonstrate outstanding
performance in the areas to be benchmarked. Their methods are studied,
documented, and used to set goals and redesign existing practices for
superior performance.

Other forms of external information, such as demographic trends,
economic forecasts, and competitors' actions can be used in goal
setting. External information is valuable because it can force an
organization to go beyond incremental goal setting.

Organizations need information to identify feasible, motivating, and
challenging goals. Once these goals have been established, they need
information on the extent to which these goals have been attained.

#### Gap information {-}

Because goals are meant to be challenging, there is often a gap between
actual and desired performance. Organizations use a number of mechanisms
to detect a gap and gain some idea of its size. Problem identification
and scorekeeping are two principal methods of providing gap information.

##### Problem identification {-}

Business conditions are continually changing because of competitors'
actions, trends in consumer demand, and government actions. Often these
changes are reflected in a gap between expectations and present
performance. This gap is known as a problem.

To identify problems, managers use exception reports, which are
generated only when conditions vary from the established goal or
standard. Once a potential problem has been identified, managers collect
additional information to confirm that a problem really exists. Once
management has been alerted, the information delivery system needs to
shift into high gear. Managers will request rapid delivery of ad hoc
reports from a variety of sources. The ideal organizational memory
system can adapt smoothly to deliver appropriate information quickly.

##### Scorekeeping {-}

Keeping track of the score provides gap information. Managers ask many
questions: How many items did we make yesterday? What were the sales
last week? Has our market share increased in the last year? They
establish measurement systems to track variables that indicate whether
organizational performance is on target. Keeping score is important;
managers need to measure in order to manage. Also, measurement lets
people know what is important. Once a manager starts to measure
something, subordinates surmise that this variable must be important and
pay more attention to the factors that influence it.

There are many aspects of the score that a manager can measure. The
overwhelming variety of potentially available information is illustrated
by the sales output information that a sales manager could track. Sales
input information (e.g., number of service calls) can also be measured,
and there is qualitative information to be considered. Because of time
constraints, most managers are forced to limit their attention to 10 or
fewer key variables singled out by the critical success factors (CSF)
method.^9^ Scorekeeping information is usually fairly stable.

*Sales output tracking information*

  Category       Example
  -------------- -----------------------------------
  Orders         Number of current customers
                 Average order size
                 Batting average (orders to calls)
  Sales volume   Dollar sales volume
                 Unit sales volume
                 By customer type
                 By product category
                 Translated to market share
                 Quota achieved
  Margins        Gross margin
                 Net profit
                 By customer type
                 By product
  Customers      Number of new accounts
                 Number of lost accounts
                 Percentage of accounts sold
                 Number of accounts overdue
                 Dollar value of receivables
                 Collections of receivables

### Change information {-}

Accurate change information is very valuable because it enables managers
to predict the outcome of various actions to close a gap with some
certainty. Unfortunately, change information is usually not very
precise, and there are many variables that can influence the effect of
any planned change. Nevertheless, organizations spend a great deal of
time collecting information to support problem solving and planning.

#### Problem solution {-}

Once a concern has been identified, a manager seeks to find its cause. A
decrease in sales could be the result of competitors introducing a new
product, an economic downturn, an ineffective advertising campaign, or
many other reasons. Data can be collected to test each of these possible
causes. Additional data are usually required to support analysis of each
alternative. For example, if the sales decrease has been caused by an
economic recession, the manager might use a decision support system
(DSS) to analyze the effect of a price decrease or a range of
promotional activities.

#### Infromation as a means of change {-}

The emergence of an information society means that information can be
used as a means of changing an organization's performance. Corporations
can create information-based products and services, adding information
to products, and using information to enhance existing performance or
gain a competitive advantage. Further insights into the use of
information as a change agent are gained by examining marketing,
customer service, and empowerment.

#### Marketing {-}

Marketing is a key strategy for changing organizational performance by
increasing sales. Information has become an important component in
marketing. Airlines and retailers have established frequent flyer and
buyer programs to encourage customer loyalty and gain more information
about customers. These systems are heavily dependent on database
technology because of the massive volume of data that must be stored.
Indeed, without database technology, some marketing strategies could
never be implemented.

Database technology offers the opportunity to change the very nature of
communications with customers. Broadcast media have been the traditional
approach to communication. Advertisements are aired on television,
placed in magazines, or displayed on a Web site. Database technology can
be used to address customers directly. No longer just a mailing list,
today's database is a memory of customer relationships, a record of
every message and response between the firm and a customer. Some
companies keep track of customers' preferences and customize
advertisements to their needs. Leading online retailers now send
customers only those emails for products for which they estimate there
is a high probability of a purchase. For example, a customer with a
history of buying jazz music is sent an email promoting jazz recordings
instead of one featuring classical music.

The Web has significantly enhanced the value of database technology.
Many firms now use a combination of a Web site and a DBMS to market
products and service customers.

#### Customer Service {-}

Many American business leaders rank customer service as their most
important goal for organizational success. Many of the developed
economies are service driven. In the United States, services account for
nearly 80 percent of the GNP and most of the new jobs. Many companies
now compete for customers by offering superior customer service.
Information is frequently a key to this improved service.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

#### Empowerment {-}

Empowerment means giving employees greater freedom to make decisions.
More precisely, it is sharing with frontline employees

* information about the organization's performance;

* rewards based on the organization's performance;

* knowledge and information that enable employees to understand and
contribute to organizational performance;

* power to make decisions that influence organizational direction and
performance.

Notice that information features prominently in the process. A critical
component is giving employees access to the information they need to
perform their tasks with a high degree of independence and discretion.
Information is empowerment. By linking employees to organizational
memory, data managers play a pivotal role in empowering people.
Empowerment can contribute to organizational performance by increasing
the quality of products and services. Together, empowerment and
information are mechanisms of planned change.

### Information and managerial work {-}

Because managers frequently use data management systems in their normal
activities as a source of information about change and as a means of
implementing change, it is crucial for systems designers to understand
how managers work. Failure to take account of managerial behavior can
result in a system that is technically sound but rarely used because it
does not fit the social system.

Studies over several decades reveal a very consistent pattern:
Managerial work is very fragmented. Managers spend an average of 10
minutes on any task, and their day is organized into brief periods of
concentrated attention to a variety of tasks. They work unrelentingly
and are frequently interrupted by unexpected disturbances. Managers are
action oriented and rely on intuition and judgment far more than
contemplative analysis of information.

Managers strongly prefer oral communication. They spend a great deal of
time conversing directly or by telephone. Managers use interpersonal
communication to establish networks, which they later use as a source of
information and a way to make things happen. The continual flow of
verbal information helps them make sense of events and lets them feel
the organizational pulse.

Managers rarely use formal reporting systems. They do not spend their
time analyzing computer reports or querying databases but resort to
formal reports to confirm impressions, should interpersonal
communications suggest there is a problem. Even when managers are
provided with a purpose-built, ultra-friendly executive information
system, their behavior changes very little. They may access a few
screens during the day, but oral communication is still their preferred
method of data gathering and dissemination.

#### Managers' information requirements {-}

Managers have certain requirements of the information they receive.
These expectations should shape a data management system's content and
how data are processed.

Managers expect to receive information that is useful for their current
task under existing business conditions. Unfortunately, managerial tasks
can change rapidly. The interlinked, global, economic environment is
highly turbulent. Since managers' expectations are not stable, the
information delivery system must be sufficiently flexible to meet
changing requirements.

Managers' demands for information vary with their perception of its
hardness; they require only one source that scores 10 on the information
hardness scale. The Nikkei Index at the close of today's market is the
same whether you read it in the *Asian Wall Street Journal* or *The
Western Australian* or hear it on CNN. As perceived hardness decreases,
managers demand more information, hoping to resolve uncertainty and gain
a more accurate assessment of the situation. When the reliability of a
source is questionable, managers seek confirmation from other sources.
If a number of different sources provide consistent information, a
manager gains confidence in the information's accuracy.

*Relationship of perceived information hardness to volume of information requested*

![](Figures/Chapter 2/hardness-volume tradeoff.png)

It is not unusual, therefore, to have a manager seek information from a
database, a conversation with a subordinate, and a contact in another
organization. If a manager gets essentially the same information from
each source, she or he has the confirmation sought. This means each data
management system should be designed to minimize redundancy, but
different components of organizational memory can supply overlapping
information.

#### Managers' needs for information vary accordingly with responsibilities {-}

Operational managers need detailed, short-term information to deal with
well-defined problems in areas such as sales, service, and production.
This information comes almost exclusively from internal sources that
report recent performance in the manager's area. A sales manager may get
weekly reports of sales by each direct report.

As managers move up the organizational hierarchy, their information
needs both expand and contract. They become responsible for a wider
range of activities and are charged with planning the future of the
organization, which requires information from external sources on
long-term economic, demographic, political, and social trends. Despite
this long-term focus, top-level managers also monitor short-term,
operational performance. In this instance, they need less detail and
more summary and exception reports on a small number of key indicators.
To avoid information overload as new layers of information needs are
added, the level of detail on the old layers naturally must decline, as
illustrated in the following figure.

*Management level and information need*

![](Figures/Chapter 2/onion model.jpg)

#### Information satisficing {-}

Because managers face making many decisions in a short period, most do
not have the time or resources to collect and interpret all the
information they need to make the best decision. Consequently, they are
often forced to satisfice. That is, they accept the first satisfactory
decision they discover. They also satisfice in their information search,
collecting only enough information to make a satisfactory decision.

Ultimately, information satisficing leads to lower-quality decision
making. If, however, information systems can accelerate delivery and
processing of the right information, then managers should be able to
move beyond selecting the first satisfactory decision to selecting the
best of several satisfactory decisions.

### Information delivery systems {-}

Most organizations have a variety of delivery systems to provide
information to managers. Developed over many years, these systems are
integrated, usually via a Web site, to give managers better access to
information. There are two aspects to information delivery. First, there
is a need for software that accesses an organizational memory, extracts
the required data, and formats it for presentation. We can use the
categories of organizational memories introduced in Chapter 1 to
describe the software side of information delivery systems. The second
aspect of delivery is the hardware that gets information from a computer
to the manager.

                          Groupware

Software is used to move data to and from organizational memory. There
is usually tight coupling between software and the format of an
organizational memory. For example, a relational database management
system can access tables but not decision-support models. This tight
coupling is particularly frustrating for managers who often want
integrated information from several organizational memories. For
example, a sales manager might expect a monthly report to include
details of recent sales (from a relational database) to be combined with
customer comments (from email messages to a customer service system). A
quick glance at the preceding table shows that there are many different
information delivery systems. We will discuss each of these briefly to
illustrate the lack of integration of organizational memories.

##### Verbal exchange {-}

Conversations, meetings, and oral reporting are commonly used methods of
information delivery. Indeed, managers show a strong preference for
verbal exchange as a method for gathering information. This is not
surprising because we are accustomed to oral information. This is the
way we learned for thousands of years as a preliterate culture. Only
recently have we learned to make decisions using spreadsheets and
computer reports.

##### Voice mail {-}

Voice mail is useful for people who do not want to be interrupted. It
supports asynchronous communication; that is, the two parties to the
conversation are not simultaneously connected. Voice-mail systems also
can store many prerecorded messages that can be selectively replayed
using a phone's keypad. Organizations use this feature to support
standard customer queries.

##### Electronic mail {-}

Email is an important system of information delivery. It too supports
asynchronous messaging, and it is less costly than voice mail for
communication. Many documents are exchanged as attachments to email.

##### Written report {-}

Formal, written reports have a long history in organizations. Before
electronic communication, they were the main form of information
delivery. They still have a role in organizations because they are an
effective method of integrating information of varying hardness and from
a variety of organizational memories. For example, a report can contain
text, tables, graphics, and images.

Written reports are often supplemented by a verbal presentation of the
key points in the report. Such a presentation enhances the information
delivered, because the audience has an opportunity to ask questions and
get an immediate response.

##### Meetings {-}

Because managers spend 30-80 percent of their time in meetings, these
are a key source of information.

##### Groupware {-}

Since meetings occupy so much managerial time and in many cases are
poorly planned and managed, organizations are looking for improvements.
Groupware is a general term applied to a range of software systems
designed to improve some aspect of group work. It is excellent for
tapping soft information and the informal side of organizational memory.

##### Management information system {-}

Management information systems are a common method of delivering
information from data management systems. A preplanned query is often
used to extract the data. Managers who have developed some skills in
using a query language might create custom reports as needed.

Preplanned reports often contain too much or too detailed information,
because they are designed in anticipation of a manager's needs.
Customized reports do not have these shortcomings, but they are often
more expensive and time consuming because they need to be prepared by an
analyst.

##### Web {-}

Word processing, desktop publishing, or HTML editors are used for
preparing documents that are disseminated by placing them on a Web
server for convenient access and sharing.

##### Image processing system {-}

An image processing system (IPS) captures data using a scanner to
digitize an image. Images in the form of letters, reports,
illustrations, and graphics have always been an important type of
organizational memory. An IPS permits these forms of information to be
captured electronically and disseminated.

##### Computer-aided design {-}

Computer-aided design (CAD) is used extensively to create graphics. For
example, engineers use CAD in product design, and architects use it for
building design. These plans are a part of organizational memory for
designers and manufacturers.

##### Geographic information system {-}

Many cities uses a geographic information system (GIS) to store
graphical data about roads, utilities, and services. This information is
another form of organizational memory.

##### Decision support system {-}

A decision support system (DSS) is frequently a computer-based
mathematical model of a problem. DSS software, available in a range of
packages, permits the model and data to be retrieved and executed. Model
parameters can be varied to investigate alternatives.

##### Expert system {-}

An expert system (ES) has captured the knowledge of someone who is
particularly skillful at solving a certain type of problem. It is
convenient to think of an ES as a set of rules. An ES is typically used
interactively, as it asks the decision-maker questions and uses the
responses to make a recommendation.

### Information integration {-}

A fundamental problem for most organizations is that their memory is
fragmented across a wide variety of formats and technologies. Too
frequently, there is a one-to-one correspondence between an
organizational memory for a particular functional area and the software
delivery system. For example, sales information is delivered by the
sales system and production information by the production system. This
is not a very desirable situation because managers want all the
information they need, regardless of its source or format, amalgamated
into a single report.

A common solution is to develop software, such as a Web application,
that integrates information from a variety of delivery systems. An
important task of this apl is to integrate and present information from
multiple organizational memories. Recently, some organizations have
created vast integrated data stores---data warehouses--- that are
organized repositories of organizational data.

### Knowledge {-}

The performance of many organizations is determined more by their
cognitive capabilities and knowledge than their physical assets. A
nation's wealth is increasingly a result of the knowledge and skills of
its citizens, rather than its natural resources and industrial plants.
Currently, about 85 percent of all jobs in America and 80 percent of
those in Europe are knowledge-based.

An organization's knowledge, in order of increasing importance, is

* cognitive knowledge (know what);

* advanced skills (know how);

* system understanding and trained intuition (know why);

* self-motivated creativity (care why).

This text illustrates the different types of knowledge. You will develop
cognitive knowledge in Section 4, when you learn about data
architectures and implementations. For example, knowing what storage
devices can be used for archival data is cognitive knowledge. Section 2,
data modeling and SQL, develops advanced skills because, upon completion
of that section, you will know how to model data and write SQL queries.
The first two chapters expand your understanding of the influence of
organizational memory on organizational performance. You need to know
why you should learn data management skills. Managers know when and why
to apply technology, whereas technicians know what to apply and how to
apply it. Finally, you are probably an IS major, and your coursework is
inculcating the values and norms of the IS profession so that you care
why problems are solved using information technology.

Organizations tend to spend more on developing cognitive skills than
they do on fostering creativity. This is, unfortunately, the wrong
priority. Returns are likely to be much greater when higher-level
knowledge skills are developed. Well-managed organizations place more
attention on creating know why and care why skills because they
recognize that knowledge is a key competitive weapon. Furthermore, these
firms have learned that knowledge grows, often very rapidly, when
shared. Knowledge is like a communication network whose potential
benefit grows exponentially as the nodes within the network grow
arithmetically. When knowledge is shared within the organization, or
with customers and suppliers, it multiplies as each person receiving
knowledge imparts it to someone else in the organization or a business
partner.

*Skills values vs. training expenditures (Quinn et al., 1996)*

![](Figures/Chapter 2/knowledge and training.png)

There are two types of knowledge: explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge
is codified and transferable. This textbook is an example of explicit
knowledge. Knowledge about how to design databases has been formalized
and communicated with the intention of transferring it to you, the
reader. Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge, experience, and judgment
that is difficult to codify. It is more difficult to transfer tacit
knowledge because it resides in people's minds. Usually, the transfer of
tacit knowledge requires the sharing of experiences. In learning to
model data, the subject of the next section, you will quickly learn how
to represent an entity, because this knowledge is made explicit.
However, you will find it much harder to model data, because this skill
comes with practice. Ideally, you should develop several models under
the guidance of an experienced modeler, such as your instructor, who can
pass on his or her tacit knowledge.

### Summary {-}

Information has become a key foundation for organizational growth. The
information society is founded on computer and communications
technology. The accumulation of knowledge requires a capacity to encode
and share information. Hard information is very exact. Soft information
is extremely imprecise. Rich information exchange occurs in face-to-face
conversation. Numeric reports are an example of lean information.
Organizations use information to set goals, determine the gap between
goals and achievements, determine actions to reach goals, and create new
products and services to enhance organizational performance. Managers
depend more on informal communication systems than on formal reporting
systems. They expect to receive information that meets their current,
ever changing needs. Operational managers need short-term information.
Senior executives require mainly long-term information but still have a
need for both short- and medium-term information. When managers face
time constraints, they collect only enough information to make a
satisfactory decision. Organizational memory should be integrated to
provide one interface to an organization's information stores.
