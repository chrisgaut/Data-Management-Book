In order to manage data, you need a database architecture, a design for
the storage and processing of data. Organizations strive to find an
architecture that simultaneously achieves multiple goals:

1.  Responds in a timely manner.

2.  Minimizes the cost of

      processing data,
    
      storing data,

      data delivery,

      application development.

3.  Highly secure.

The section deals with the approaches that can be used to achieve these
goals. It covers **database structure and storage** alternatives. It
provides the knowledge necessary to determine an appropriate **data
storage structure** and device for a given situation. It also addresses
the fundamental questions of where to store the data and where they
should be processed.

**Java** has become a popular choice for writing programs that operate
on multiple operating systems. Combining the interoperability of Java
with standard SQL provides software developers with an opportunity to
develop applications that can run on multiple operating systems and
multiple DBMSs, and this typically reduces the cost of application
development. Thus, for a comprehensive understanding of data management,
it is important to learn how Java and SQL interface, which is the
subject of the third chapter in this section.

As you now realize, organizational memory is an important resource
requiring management. An inaccurate memory can result in bad decisions
and poor customer service. Some aspects of organizational memory (e.g.,
chemical formulae, marketing strategy, and R&D plans) are critical to
the well-being of an organization. The financial consequences can be
extremely significant if these memories are lost or fall into the hands
of competitors. Consequently, organizations must develop and implement
procedures for maintaining data integrity. They need policies to protect
the existence of data, maintain its quality, and ensure its
confidentiality. Some of these procedures may be embedded in
organizational memory technology, and others may be performed by data
management staff. **Data integrity** is also addressed in this section.

When organizations recognize a resource as important to their long-term
viability, they typically create a formal mechanism to manage it. For
example, most companies have a human resources department responsible
for activities such as compensation, recruiting, training, and employee
counseling. People are the major resource of nearly every company, and
the human resources department manages this resource. Similarly, the
finance department manages a company's financial assets.

In the information age, data---the raw material of information---need to
be managed. Consequently, **data administration** has become a formal
organizational structure in many enterprises. It is designed to
administer the data management and exploitation resources of an
organization.
